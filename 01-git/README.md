If no ideas on what to store there, feel free to document
   * steps completed
   * questions to research for the future
6. Commit your changes (explore the process)
7. Upload your changes to remote repo
8. Find way to make some changes in the remote repo (either via web or clone\
the repo to another local place)
9. Go back to the repo created in the 2nd step
10. Get your changes implemented in the 8th step
11. Explore history of changes and difference between some commits
