# Prerequisite
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

# Learn

## Docker
1. Run some commands
   * `❯ docker version`\
Try to get the idea of the output (main components..)
   * `❯ docker run --rm hello-world`\
Surf through steps..
   * `❯ docker run -it ubuntu bash`\
Could be extended for the command line class...

## Docker Compose
1. Make sure it is installed
   * `❯ docker compose version`\
If you have compose version, which just supports `docker-compose` commands (not\
and alias for the former one), make sure to update it.
